# Inquirewin - ChatGPT Interactive CLI

Forked from the original project by [timcol](https://github.com/timcol/inquire), this version adds enhanced functionality to allow users to select from two predefined system prompts or write their own custom prompt, providing a more tailored interaction with the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

# GPT-3 Chat Assistant

This is a Python script that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to create a conversational chat assistant. The script allows users to interact with the GPT-3 model in a conversational manner, where the user can input prompts, and the model generates responses.

## Features

- Choose between default system prompts or input a custom prompt.
- Real-time interaction with the GPT-3 model for generating responses.
- Token usage monitoring to avoid hitting the token limit.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- `openai` library (install using `pip install openai`)
- `colorama` library (install using `pip install colorama`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

3. Run the script using the following command: python inquire.py

4. The script will provide you with options to choose a default system prompt or enter a custom prompt. If you choose to enter a custom prompt, follow the on-screen instructions.

5. Start the conversation by entering your input prompt. The assistant will generate responses based on the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

6. To exit the conversation, type `exit` or `quit`.

## Code Structure

- `clear_screen()`: Clears the terminal screen based on the operating system.

- `choose_prompt(prompts)`: Allows the user to choose between default prompts or a custom prompt.

- `display_system_prompts(prompts)`: Displays available system prompts and lets the user choose one.

- `estimate_tokens(conversation)`: Estimates the number of tokens in a conversation.

- `stream_gpt(prompt, conversation)`: Uses the GPT-3 model to generate responses based on the conversation.

- `system_prompts`: List of default system prompts.

- Main execution:
- If no command-line arguments are provided, the script allows the user to choose or input a prompt and initiates a conversation loop.
- If command-line arguments are provided, the script uses the provided argument as the initial prompt.

## Limitations

- The script uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model, which is a language model. It may not always provide correct or factual information.
- The conversation is limited to a token limit of 4096 tokens. Longer conversations may be truncated.
- The script doesn't handle complex multi-turn conversations with back-and-forth context.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided for educational and experimental purposes. The quality of responses generated by the GPT-3 model may vary, and it is important to critically evaluate the generated content.
